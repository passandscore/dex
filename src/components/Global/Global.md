# Introduction

This directory houses all reusable React functional components for the Ambient UI.

# About

In React, a reusable component is a piece of UI that can be used in various parts of an application to build more than one UI instance. For instance, we can have a Button component that displays different texts on different pages.

Each sub-directory in this directory contains it's own folder. This folder will include everything related to that reusable component. Due to the reusablity of some components, they will require props to function correctly. If neccessary, a tutorial of how to use these components will be included in their files ending in `.md`.
